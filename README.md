# CSV-ParseAndSort

This bit of Python code will take in the data from a .csv file in the same format as the sample, and then check each UNIX time code to see if it comes before the set date which in this case is 09/06/2010. If so, it adds it to a list, and then sorts that list in ascending order using *insertion sort*. It then prints out the message created by each separate word in the 'words' column.
